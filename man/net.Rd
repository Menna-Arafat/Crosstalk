\title{Background gene interaction network}
\format{
A data frame with three columns:
\describe{
\item{source}{Source gene or transcription factor}
\item{target}{Target gene}
\item{mor}{Mode of regulation (numeric)}
}
}
\source{
Transcription factor–target interactions from the \pkg{decoupleR} package resources and
protein–protein interactions downloaded from STRINGdb, filtered to retain intermediate
to high-confidence interactions (combined score > 400).
}
\usage{
data(net)
}
\description{
A background gene–gene interaction network used by CrosstalkX. The network integrates
transcription factor–target interactions and protein–protein interactions and is used
for mutual information estimation and crosstalk inference.
