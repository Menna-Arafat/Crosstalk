Description:
    Provides a computational framework for inferring transcription factor–pathway and
    pathway–pathway interactions from gene expression data by integrating enrichment-derived
    gene sets, mutual information-based association measures, and background gene interaction
    networks. Permutation-based null models are used to assess statistical significance and
    identify biologically meaningful pathway crosstalk. Additionally, it prioritizes genes of interest
    using DE-neighborhood enrichment, retaining genes whose network neighborhoods
    are significantly enriched for DE genes.
