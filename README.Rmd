## Under the hood of CrosstalkX
 Pathway enrichment approaches such as ORA and GSEA summarize transcriptomic changes, but
 enriched pathways are often interpreted in isolation. CrosstalkX adds a systems layer by
 quantifying functional coupling between terms (pathways and regulators) using expression
 data, a background interaction network, and mutual information (MI).

 The central idea is to move beyond "which pathways are enriched?" toward "which enriched
 pathways and regulators are coupled in the expression profile, and how strong is that
 coupling?" CrosstalkX does this by estimating MI on gene–gene edges, aggregating edge-level
 evidence to term–term scores, and assigning permutation-based significance.

## Overview:
 The tutorial proceeds in three stages. First, it prepares expression and prioritizes genes by
 testing whether their network neighborhoods are enriched for DE genes more than expected by chance.
 Second, it performs enrichment on prioritized genes.
 Third it infers significant term–term crosstalk and visualizes the result.

## Input
 CrosstalkX expects a two-column enrichment table:
 1. Pathway/term identifier
 2. Gene hits as a single string separated by "/" or ","
 And expression matrix where row names are genes and column names are samples

### Installation

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 # install.packages("devtools")
 # devtools::install_github("Menna-Arafat/CrosstalkX", 
 # build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE)

```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#load lib
library(CrosstalkX)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
```

### Module0: Data preparation
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Expression matrix is expected as genes × samples, with gene IDs in rownames.
# group_names is used downstream to support group-aware preprocessing (e.g., handling NAs).
expr = CrosstalkX::expr |> tibble::column_to_rownames("V1")
group_names = c("Normal", "Tumor")

# Differential expression results are used in two ways:
# 1) fold-change values (linear FC) for pathway enrichment with directionality
# 2) t-statistics for TF activity inference based on downstream targets
de_res = CrosstalkX::de_res |> tibble::column_to_rownames("V1")

# Convert log2 fold change to linear fold change for enrichment inputs that use FC values.
de_res$FC = 2 ^ de_res$log2FoldChange
de_fc = setNames(de_res$FC, row.names(de_res))

# Define DE genes for the gene-prioritization step.
# These represent the "labels" whose local enrichment in the network will be tested.
de_genes = de_res |>
            dplyr::filter(abs(log2FoldChange) >= log2(2), padj <= 0.01) |>
            row.names()

# Compute a signed statistic for TF enrichment.
# The t-statistic captures both effect direction and uncertainty (via the SE).
de_res$t_stat = de_res$log2FoldChange / de_res$lfcSE
tstat_named = setNames(de_res$t_stat, rownames(de_res))
```

### Module1: Gene prioritization by DE-neighborhood enrichment
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# retrieve_net() provides the interaction scaffold used to define each gene's neighborhood.
# If net is not supplied, CrosstalkX loads its bundled default network.
net = retrieve_net()

# prioritize_de() tests each gene of interest for an unusually high number of DE neighbors.
# It uses permutation to build an empirical null distribution, then returns significant genes.
myres = prioritize_de(genes_oi = row.names(expr), de_genes = de_genes, net = net)
top_de= myres$sig
head(top_de, 100)
head(top_de, 100)

```

### Module2: Enrichment

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Enrichment is performed on prioritized genes rather than on all expressed genes, which
# tends to sharpen signal by focusing on network-coherent regions enriched for DE effects.
gset = CrosstalkX::gset

# Restrict FC vector to prioritized genes before pathway enrichment.
fc_named = de_fc[names(de_fc) %in% row.names(top_de)]

# enrich_path() applies internally either ORA or GSEA enrichment functions from clusterprofiler package.
# it returns enriched pathways with member genes and direction.
# The output is standardized to the columns CrosstalkX expects downstream.
enriched_path = enrich_path(fc_named, enrich = "ORA", gset)
enriched_path = enriched_path |> dplyr::select(ID, geneID, direction)

# TF enrichment uses only regulatory edges (mor != 0) from the network.
# TF activity is inferred from the statistics of downstream targets using functions from decoupleR package.
TF = net |> dplyr::filter(mor != 0)
named_tstat = tstat_named[names(tstat_named) %in% row.names(top_de)]
enriched_tf = enrich_TF(named_tstat, net = TF)

# Combine TF and pathway enrichment into a single term table for crosstalk inference.
# This allows TF–pathway and pathway–pathway couplings to be handled uniformly.
names(enriched_tf) = names(enriched_path)
enrichment_df = rbind(enriched_tf, enriched_path)

# This example focuses on upregulated programs; adjust this filter if you want "down" or both.
enrichment_df = enrichment_df |> dplyr::filter(direction == "up")
row.names(enrichment_df) = NULL
head(enrichment_df)

```

### Module3: Crosstalk inference
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# crosstalk() is the single-call pipeline that:
# prepares term gene sets, preprocesses expression, loads/uses a background network,
# computes MI on gene–gene edges, aggregates MI to term–term scores, and runs permutation tests.
res = crosstalk(enrichment_df, expr, group_names, iter = 100)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# filtration:
# low Jaccard overlap reduces trivial links driven by shared genes,
# p-values provide permutation-based evidence of non-random coupling,
# and an MI strength filter helps focus on the stronger half of interactions.
sig = res |>
      dplyr::filter((pval_deg_norm <= 0.05 | pval_mi_norm <= 0.05) & Jaccard < 0.2) |>
      dplyr::filter(mi_norm > quantile(mi_norm, 0.5, na.rm = TRUE))

# A compact string representation of significant couplings for quick inspection.
paste0(gsub("%.*", "", sig$Term1), " >> ", gsub("%.*", "", sig$Term2))

```

### Interpretation note:
 When Jaccard overlap is low but permutation p-values are strong, the coupling is less likely
 to be a simple gene-overlap artifact and more consistent with network-mediated coordination.

### Module4: Visualization
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Nodes are labeled with shortened names for readability; colors reflect enrichment direction.
all_labels = unique(c(sig$Term1, sig$Term2))

new_labels = all_labels |>
              stringr::str_sub(1, 50) |>
              gsub("\\%.*|\\*", "", x = _) |>
              gsub("_", " ", x = _)

named_labels = setNames(new_labels, all_labels)

enrichment_df$new_colors = ifelse(enrichment_df$direction == "up", "#CC4248FF", "#2B0B57FF")
idx = match(all_labels, enrichment_df$ID)
new_colors = setNames(enrichment_df$new_colors[idx], all_labels)

# visualize_crosstalk() renders a network view of significant couplings.
visualize_crosstalk(sig, named_labels = named_labels, named_colors = new_colors)

```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# scatter_plot() shows scatter plot between jaccard similarity and crosstalk significance. low correlation indicates that inference is not derived by terms similarity..
scatter_plot(sig)

```
